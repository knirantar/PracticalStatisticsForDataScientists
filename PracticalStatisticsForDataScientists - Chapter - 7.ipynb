    "This is supervised learning. In contrast, unsupervised learning also constructs a model of the data, but it does not\n",
    "distinguish between a response variable and predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is also important as a building block for regression and classification techniques. a, if a small subpopulation is not well represented in the overall population, the trained model may not perform well for that subpopulation. With clustering, it is possible to identify and label subpopulations. Sepa‐ rate models can then be fit to the different subpopulations.\n",

    "Principal components analysis (PCA) is a technique to discover the way in which numeric variables covary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea in PCA is to combine multiple numeric predictor variables into a smaller set of variables. the principal components, “explains” most of the variability of the full set of variables, reducing the dimension of the data.\n",
